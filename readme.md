# Colorines Dark
### Some Espresso Theme

I love [MacRabbit's Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/), but I'm not happy with any of the themes I've found. So, finaly, I decided to make my own theme. Just a ***colorfull* theme** with **dark background** and silly name (yes, it's a pretty stuppid name, try to translate it from spanish, well not, don't do it, please?).

## What languages are styled?
Good question (I know, I'm the one who asked it, that's why is a good question). Since this is a theme I made for me I've started with the ones I use, and as a front-end developer these are:

* CSS
* HTML
* Javascript
* PHP
* Apache
* Markdown

The one I'm happier with is the CSS one, I just love the color combination that came out. I'm not saying that the others are not good (I wouldn't be releasing it), but I'm not 100% convinced with them, so it's likely I'll be updating them some time (or not, who knows?), in any case, the CSS bit is probably not changing ever (or really slightly), but I'm open for suggestions, always.

## Installing
Well, here you have two options, the first one is a simpple drag&drop, just find in your home folder the Library (if you're using Lion it will be hidden) and copy the css file to:
>USERFOLDER > Library > Application Support > Espresso > Themes

The other option is installing using Git with the *Terminal.app*:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Themes/

    git clone git://github.com/guill3m/Colorines-Dark.git


## What about a light version of this theme?
Maybe, sometime, I can't promise anything, but it could happen.

## What about more languages?
Today I just realized that there's a need of some XML styling, for the moment it's ok as it is since there are some defaults that fit OK, but I'll be refining it properly one of this days.
For other languages, since I'm not going to use them in a short–middle term, I'm not really thinking on expand the theme in a short term (hy, don't worry, read the next point).

## But I really want *someotherlanguage* styled
**Ok, if you love this theme (wow, thank you) you could make that bit of theme for it** (it's just CSS it's not really hard, the problem is to get the selectors ok, but when you get the point it's not that hard) and give me a touch to add it here (with the propper credits to you, obviously) and, maybe, fine tune it a little if I think it's needed.

But if you don't like CSS (shame on you), or you're just lazy (hey, don't worry, it happens to all of us) I have other method that can be interesting for both of us:

* You could send me an image, or html styled with css, or whatever think I can see how that language should be styled as (prefereably with colors similar as the ones used on the themes, as they are most likely the ones I'm going to use).
* In addition to the "styled" images/something attach me some piece of code where I can see all the kinds of tags, selectors, variables, shit… that should be styled so I can use it as a reference for seeing if it's all coming up good.

## Suggestions or collaborations on making this theme even more awesome
I'm always open to suggestions, **always** (and if you want to correct my crappy english, that's welcomed to). And if you'd like to collaborate you can to, it's described on the previous point.

## OK, enough bla bla bla
If you really readed all this nonsense just for a theme you've earned my respect, seriously, now you're free to try *Colorines Dark*.
